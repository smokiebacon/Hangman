# Instructions for the game
The goal of this game is to figure out the missing word. Buttons of the alphabet will be provided in order to complete this.

Player will have 6 chances to guess any incorrect letters in order to solve the missing word. After 6 chances have been given and player does not solve the puzzle, all alphabet buttons will be disabled and will not allow the player to continue with the same game. A message will display, "Sorry! You've run out of chances!" and the player will then have to click the "Reset Game" button to start a new game.  

If player solves the missing word, all buttons will be disabled and a message will display "Congratulations!! You've solved HangMan!".

# Planned features

For advanced features, I'd like to use the Pokemon API to get a list of every Pokemon in the game and randomly select a Pokemon name and elemental type to use in Hangman.

Then, also display hints to the user of what type of Pokemon it is (such as Electric, Flying, Fire, Water, etc).

Also, when the player wins, display the image of the correctly guessed Pokemon.

Use key events to listen for the letters that your players will type.
