# Planned features

For advanced features, I'd like to use the Pokemon API to get a list of every Pokemon in the game and randomly select a Pokemon name and use use it's elemental type as hints.

Also, when the player wins, display the image of the correctly guessed Pokemon.

Use keyboard events to listen for the letters that your players will type.

Make it true to Pokemon: Trainer vs trainer, 6 versus 6. Opponents Pokemon will show up, player must guess the name. As player guesses the name, increase score by 1 and a new pokemon will be summoned.
As player loses, player's Pokemon in play is knocked out and next Pokemon come's out. PLayer will have 6 Pokemon
in their team.
