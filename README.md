# Instructions for the game
The goal of this game is to figure out the missing word. An alphabet will be provided in order to complete this.
Player will have 6 chances to guess any inncorrect letters in order to solve the missing word(s). After 6 chances have been given and player does not solve the puzzle, all alphabet buttons will be disabled and will not allow the player to continue with the same game. A message will display, "Sorry! You've run out of chances!" and the player will then have to click the "Reset Game" button to start a new game.  If player solves the missing word, all buttons will be disabled and a message will display "Congratulations!! You've solved HangMan!". If player would like to play a new game after their victory, simply click on the "Reset Game" button. :)

# Planned features
There are a few more features I'd like to add to this game. First, I'd like to create several categories for this HangMan game so it doesn't always have to be a Nickelodeon theme everytime the player plays. With said, I'd like to customize each category with a themed page (such as this game) for a more user-friendly experience. Second, I'd like to add a photo of the solved word next to the (if) solved word so the player can have a better picture of that they actually solved. For example, in this particular game, if player is not familiar with Sandy Cheeks for the Nickelodeon show, SpongeBob Squarepants, I'd like to have her photo appear if player solves that randomized word. My third planned feature is to create a message that will appear once player is getting close to running out of chances.
